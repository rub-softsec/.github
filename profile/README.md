We are the [Chair for Software Security](https://informatik.rub.de/softsec/), led by [Prof. Dr. Kevin Borgolte](https://github.com/cao), in the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://informatik.rub.de/en/) at [Ruhr University Bochum (RUB)](https://rub.de/en).
Our research focuses on the various areas of software security, the related area Internet security, and also connected privacy issues.
We conduct research that concerns itself with real-world software and systems.
The group’s research focus is on, but not limited to, the areas of:

* **Software security**: We explore how to improve, extend, and develop new program analysis techniques for real-world (automatic) vulnerability discovery, including network protocol analysis.
* **Software privacy**: We develop analysis techniques to understand how programs behave in terms of their privacy behavior.
* **Internet security**: We work on addressing (large-scale) Internet security issues, such as malware and denial-of-service attacks, and we address measurement blindspots for Internet security measurements.
* **Internet privacy**: We study if and how changes in deployed software and Internet protocols affect user privacy, and we develop measurement techniques to assess the impact.

A list of our academic publications is also available on [our website "Publications."](https://informatik.rub.de/softsec/research/publications)
We collaborate closely with the partners from the [Cluster of Excellence CASA (Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries)](https://casa.rub.de/en), the [Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security HGI](https://hgi.rub.de/en), and various other universities and research labs through the [International Secure Systems Lab (iSecLab)](https://iseclab.org).

We are always looking for talented and bright PhD students or postdocs to join our team, as well as visiting PhD students for research internships.
